#tic tac toe  -- ONLINE (QT)
Hello everyone, my name is Anton and this is my game for 2 players from different devices tic-tac-toe, the basis of the classic game of tic-tac-toe 
but I use a LAN connection, one device is the host and the other is connected. 
To start the game you need to enter the IP and if everything is correct you can play together. The game is written in c++, more specifically in QT.
